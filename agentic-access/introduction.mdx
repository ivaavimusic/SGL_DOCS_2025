# Agentic Access: Introduction

x402 Studio enables AI agents to discover, evaluate, and pay for API access automatically, without human intervention.

## What is Agentic Access?

Agentic access means your API can be called by autonomous systems (AI agents, automated scripts, bots) that:

1.  **Discover** – Find your API and understand its pricing
2.  **Evaluate** – Decide if the price is worth paying
3.  **Pay** – Submit payment cryptographically
4.  **Access** – Receive the response after payment verification

All of this happens in a single request-response cycle.

## The 402 Protocol

HTTP status code `402 Payment Required` was reserved for exactly this use case.

```
Client → Server: GET /api/data
Server → Client: 402 Payment Required + payment details
Client → Server: GET /api/data + X-Payment header
Server → Client: 200 OK + actual response
```
