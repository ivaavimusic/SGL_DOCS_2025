# Agentic Access: Introduction

x402 Studio enables AI agents to discover, evaluate, and pay for API access automatically, without human intervention.

## What is Agentic Access?

Agentic access means your API can be called by autonomous systems (AI agents, automated scripts, bots) that:

1.  **Discover** – Find your API and understand its pricing
2.  **Evaluate** – Decide if the price is worth paying
3.  **Pay** – Submit payment cryptographically
4.  **Access** – Receive the response after payment verification

All of this happens in a single request-response cycle on any supported chain:
- **Base** (Coinbase L2)
- **Solana** (High-speed L1)
- **Ethereum** (Mainnet & Sepolia)
- **Polygon** (PoS & Amoy)
- **BSC** (BNB Chain)
- **Monad** (Parallel EVM L1)

## The 402 Protocol

HTTP status code `402 Payment Required` was reserved for exactly this use case.

```
Client → Server: GET /api/data
Server → Client: 402 Payment Required + payment details
Client → Server: GET /api/data + X-Payment header
Server → Client: 200 OK + actual response
```

## Base Endpoint & Authentication

### Gateway URL

All x402-enabled endpoints are accessible through our gateway:

```
https://api.x402layer.cc
```

### Endpoint Paths

Each endpoint has a unique slug accessible at:

```
https://api.x402layer.cc/e/{slug}
```

For example, if an endpoint's slug is `my-api`, the full URL would be:
```
https://api.x402layer.cc/e/my-api
```

### Authentication

For non-agentic access (e.g., testing, direct API calls with credits), use the `x-header-key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.x402layer.cc/e/my-api \
  -H "x-header-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

API keys can be generated from the [Dashboard](/dashboard).

<Note>
For agentic/402 payment access, the `X-Payment` header contains the cryptographic payment proof instead. See [Pay-Per-Request](/docs/agentic-access/pay-per-request) for details.
