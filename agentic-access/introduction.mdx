# Introduction to Agentic Access

x402 Studio enables AI agents to discover, evaluate, and pay for API access automatically, without human intervention.

## What is Agentic Access?

Agentic access means your API can be called by autonomous systems (AI agents, automated scripts, bots) that:

1. **Discover** – Find your API and understand its pricing
2. **Evaluate** – Decide if the price is worth paying
3. **Pay** – Submit payment cryptographically
4. **Access** – Receive the response after payment verification

All of this happens in a single request-response cycle.

## The 402 Protocol

HTTP status code `402 Payment Required` was reserved for exactly this use case.

```
Client → Server: GET /api/data
Server → Client: 402 Payment Required + payment details
Client → Server: GET /api/data + X-Payment header
Server → Client: 200 OK + actual response
```

## Why Use x402 for Agents?

- **Automatic Discovery**: Agents don't need documentation. They call your endpoint and receive machine-readable payment instructions.
- **Instant Payment**: No invoices, no approval workflows. The agent signs a transaction and includes it with the request.
- **Multi-Chain**: Agents can pay on whichever chain has their funds: Base or Solana.
- **Credit Efficiency**: For high-volume agents, credit-based pricing reduces per-call overhead.
