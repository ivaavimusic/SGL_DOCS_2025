# OpenClaw x402-Layer Skill

The **x402-layer** skill enables [OpenClaw](https://x.com/openclaw) agents to interact with x402 Singularity Layer for autonomous API monetization and consumption.

<Note>
  This skill is production-ready and has been tested with real payments on **Base (EVM)** and **Solana** networks.
</Note>

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# In your OpenClaw agent's skills directory
git clone https://github.com/ivaavimusic/x402-layer-skill.git x402-layer
cd x402-layer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# For Base (EVM) - Recommended
export PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
export WALLET_ADDRESS="0x..."

# For Solana (Optional)
export SOLANA_SECRET_KEY="[1,2,3,...]"  # JSON array
```

## Usage Examples

### Pay for an Endpoint (Consumer)

```bash
# Pay with Base (recommended - 100% success rate)
python scripts/pay_base.py https://api.x402layer.cc/e/weather-data

# Pay with Solana (includes retry logic)
python scripts/pay_solana.py https://api.x402layer.cc/e/weather-data
```

### Use Credits (Fastest)

```bash
# Check balance
python scripts/check_credits.py weather-data

# Buy credits
python scripts/recharge_credits.py weather-data pack_100

# Consume with credits (zero blockchain latency)
python scripts/consume_credits.py https://api.x402layer.cc/e/weather-data
```

### Create Your Own Endpoint (Provider)

```bash
# Deploy a monetized endpoint ($5 one-time fee, includes 20K test credits)
python scripts/create_endpoint.py my-api "My AI Service" https://api.example.com 0.01

# Top up YOUR endpoint with credits
python scripts/topup_endpoint.py my-api 10  # Add $10 worth

# List on marketplace
python scripts/list_on_marketplace.py my-api --category ai --description "AI-powered analysis"
```

### Browse Marketplace

```bash
# List all services
python scripts/discover_marketplace.py

# Search by keyword
python scripts/discover_marketplace.py search weather

# Get featured endpoints
python scripts/discover_marketplace.py featured
```

## Technical Details

### Base (EVM) Payments

Uses EIP-712 `TransferWithAuthorization` signatures:
- Gasless for the payer
- Facilitator settles on-chain
- 100% reliable

### Solana Payments

Uses `VersionedTransaction` with `MessageV0`:
- Facilitator pays gas fees
- SPL Token `TransferChecked` instruction
- ~75% success rate (facilitator fee payer infrastructure issue)
- Retry logic built into the script

<Warning>
  Solana payments have ~75% success rate due to facilitator-side fee payer infrastructure issues. 
  Base (EVM) payments are 100% reliable and recommended for production use.
</Warning>
