# Wallet Connection

x402 Studio uses crypto wallets for authentication and receiving payments. Connect wallets on both Base (EVM) and Solana networks.

## Supported Wallets

### Base (EVM)
- **Coinbase Wallet** - Direct integration
- **MetaMask** - RainbowKit modal
- **WalletConnect** - RainbowKit modal
- **Rainbow** - RainbowKit modal

### Solana
- **Phantom** - Native adapter
- **Solflare** - Native adapter
- **Backpack** - Native adapter

## Connecting Your Wallet

### Step 1: Click Connect
On any page, click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top navigation bar.

### Step 2: Choose Your Network
Select **Base** to open the wallet selector or **Solana** to see available wallets.

### Step 3: Approve the Connection
Your wallet will ask you to connect and sign a message to prove ownership. No transaction, no gas fees!

## Managing Multiple Wallets

You can connect wallets from different chains to the same account:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Settings**
2. Add additional wallets
3. Choose which wallet receives payments for each endpoint

## Troubleshooting

- **Wallet not showing up?** Make sure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked. Try refreshing the page.
- **Connection rejected?** Look for a popup in your wallet that may be hidden. Some wallets require manual approval.
- **Wrong network?** Open your wallet, switch to Base Mainnet or Solana Mainnet, then reconnect.
