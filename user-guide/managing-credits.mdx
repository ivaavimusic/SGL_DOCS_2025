# Managing Credits

Credits provide a flexible pricing model where users purchase credit packs upfront and consume credits per API call.

## How Credits Work

1.  **You set** how many credits each API call costs
2.  **Users buy** credit packs at prices you define
3.  **Credits are consumed** automatically with each request
4.  **Users see** their remaining balance and can top up anytime

## Setting Up Credit Packages

Define packages users can purchase:

| Package | Credits | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Starter Pack | 100 credits | $1 |
| Standard Pack | 1,000 credits | $8 |
| Pro Pack | 10,000 credits | $50 |

> Tip: Offer discounts for larger packs to encourage upfront purchases.

## Checking Credit Balance

Users can check their balance via the API:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.x402layer.cc/api/credits/balance" \
  -H "x-wallet-address: 0xYourWallet..."
```

```json Response
{
  "credits": 850,
  "endpoint": "your-slug"
}
```

## Using Credits (For API Callers)

When making API calls with credits, include your wallet address:

```bash
curl "https://api.x402layer.cc/api/public/endpoints/your-slug" \
  -H "x-wallet-address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2bD87"
```

If you have sufficient credits, the request goes through. Otherwise, you receive a `402` response prompting credit purchase.

## Best Practices

*   **Start with simple pricing** – 1 credit = 1 cent makes math easy
*   **Offer volume discounts** – Encourage larger purchases with 10-20% off
*   **Monitor usage patterns** – Adjust pricing based on actual consumption
*   **Communicate clearly** – Show exact credit cost before users call your API
