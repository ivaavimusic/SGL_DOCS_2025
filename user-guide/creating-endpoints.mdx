# Creating Endpoints

Endpoints are the core of x402 Studio. They turn your APIs into paid services that accept crypto payments automatically.

## Endpoint Types

### Pay-Per-Request
Charge a fixed price for each API call. Best for:
- High-value API responses
- Compute-intensive operations
- Premium data access

### Credit-Based
Sell credit packs upfront. Best for:
- High-volume APIs
- Subscription-like access
- Lighter per-call pricing

## Creating a New Endpoint

### Step 1: Navigate to Endpoints
Go to **Dashboard → Endpoints** and click **New Endpoint**.

### Step 2: Basic Information

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | A descriptive name for your endpoint |
| Description | What this endpoint does (shown to users) |
| Origin URL | Your actual API endpoint URL |

### Step 3: Set Your Payout Address
Enter the wallet address where you want to receive payments:

```text
0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2bD87
```

> ⚠️ Double-check this address. Payments are irreversible once sent.

## Testing Your Endpoint

After creation, test that everything works:

```bash
# Get the 402 challenge
curl https://api.x402layer.cc/api/public/endpoints/your-slug

# Expected: 402 Payment Required with payment details
```

## Managing Endpoints
From the Dashboard, you can:
- **Edit** – Update pricing, origin URL, or settings
- **Pause** – Temporarily disable the endpoint
- **Delete** – Permanently remove the endpoint
- **View Analytics** – See payment history and usage stats
