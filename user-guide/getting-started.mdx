# Getting Started with x402 Studio

This guide will help you set up x402 Studio and create your first paid endpoint in under 10 minutes.

Whether you are a creator looking to monetize your APIs, or a user exploring our [Marketplace](/docs/user-guide/marketplace), x402Studio provides the tools you need.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

*   **Authentication** – Connect your wallet to automatically create your x402Studio account
*   **A crypto wallet** – Either a Base-compatible wallet (like Coinbase Wallet) or a Solana wallet (like Phantom)
*   **Some USDC** – For testing payments on Base or Solana mainnet
*   **An API endpoint or digital item** – A public URL or digital good you want to monetize via our Marketplace

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1.  Visit **studio.x402layer.cc**
2.  Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right
3.  Choose your wallet type:
    *   **Base**: Connect via Coinbase Wallet or RainbowKit
    *   **Solana**: Connect via Phantom or another Solana wallet
4.  Sign the authentication message

Your wallet is now linked to your x402 Studio account.

## Step 2: Create Your First Endpoint

1.  Go to **Dashboard → Endpoints → New**
2.  Fill in the endpoint details:
    *   **Name**: A description for your endpoint
    *   **Origin URL**: Your actual API endpoint
    *   **Price**: How much to charge per call (in USDC)
    *   **Chain**: Where to receive payments (Base or Solana)
3.  Click **Create Endpoint**

You'll receive a public slug like `/api/public/endpoints/my-endpoint`

## Step 3: Test Your Endpoint

Try calling your new endpoint:

```bash
curl https://studio.x402layer.cc/api/public/endpoints/my-endpoint
```

You'll receive a `402 Payment Required` response with payment details:

```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "accepts": [
    {
      "network": "base",
      "asset": "usdc",
      "payTo": "0xYourWallet...",
      "maxAmountRequired": "1000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells clients exactly how to pay for access.
