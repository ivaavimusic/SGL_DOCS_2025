# Components Library

x402 Studio offers ready-to-use payment components you can embed directly into your website. Each component creates x402 endpoints automatically and handles crypto payments seamlessly.

> **Requirement:** Components are available on Pro and Business plans only.
>
> Business plan users can hide the x402 branding from their components.

## Creating a Component

All components follow a simple 3-step wizard:

### 1. Design Your Component
Customize the appearance: titles, subtitles, pricing tiers, features, and button text. See your changes in the live preview as you edit.
*   Set tier names and pricing (monthly/yearly for subscriptions)
*   Add feature lists for each tier
*   Mark tiers as "Popular" to highlight them
*   Toggle the x402 branding (Business plan only)

### 2. Create x402 Endpoints
Each tier automatically creates x402 payment endpoints. You just need to:
*   Choose a unique slug for each endpoint (e.g., `my-saas-pro-monthly`)
*   Select your payment network (Base or Solana)
*   Your default wallet is used automatically

> **Note:** Subscription components create 2 endpoints per tier (monthly + yearly). Make sure you have enough endpoint quota.

### 3. Get Your Embed Code
Once created, you'll receive embed codes to add to your website:

**iframe Embed (Recommended)**
```html
<iframe
  src="https://studio.x402layer.cc/embed/abc123xy"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
  style="border: none; border-radius: 16px;"
></iframe>
```

**Script Embed**
```html
<script src="https://studio.x402layer.cc/embed/abc123xy.js"></script>
<div id="x402-subscription"></div>
```

## Managing Components

After creating components, manage them from **Dashboard → Components**:
*   **View Transactions:** See all payments received through your component endpoints, with wallet addresses and amounts.
*   **Export Data:** Download transaction history as CSV for accounting and analytics.
*   **Toggle Active Status:** Quickly enable or disable a component without deleting it.
*   **Copy Embed Code:** Quick access to copy your embed code from the component list.

### Subscription Modal
Perfect for SaaS and recurring revenue. Users see a modal with your pricing tiers and can toggle between monthly and yearly billing.

**Endpoints created:**
