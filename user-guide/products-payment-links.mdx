# Products & Payment Links

Bundle your offerings into products and share payment links anywhere.

## Products

Products let you package endpoints and set clearer pricing for buyers.

| Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Access** | Grants endpoint access | Premium API tier |
| **Digital Download** | Delivers a file | E-book, dataset |
| **Service** | Triggers a webhook | Account upgrade |

## Payment Links

Payment links are shareable URLs that take users directly to a payment page.

Your link will look like:
`https://studio.x402layer.cc/pay/abc123`

Share this anywhere:
*   Social media
*   Email campaigns
*   QR codes
*   Support tickets

## Creating Payment Links

1.  Go to **Dashboard → Payment Links → New**
2.  Configure the link:
    *   **Product or Amount** – What they're paying for
    *   **Chain** – Base or Solana
    *   **Redirect URL** – Where to send after payment (optional)
3.  Share your generated link

## Invoices

For B2B or custom quotes, use invoices:
*   **Due dates** – Set payment terms
*   **Custom amounts** – Flexible pricing
*   **Multiple items** – Line itemized billing
*   **Payment history** – Track all invoice payments
