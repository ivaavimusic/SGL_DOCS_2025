Detailed Changes (1.0.2 -> 1.0.3)
[done] Version bump to 1.0.3 in SKILL metadata.
[done] Added compute management auth model documentation:
       - Signature auth (X-Auth-* headers)
       - API key auth (X-API-Key)
[done] Added one-time password fallback workflow:
       - New endpoint documented: POST /compute/instances/:id/password
       - New helper script: scripts/get_one_time_password.py
[done] Added AWAL bridge helper script:
       - scripts/awal_bridge.py
[done] Added AWAL payment path in scripts/provision.py.
[done] Added AWAL payment path in scripts/extend_instance.py.
[done] Fixed AWAL auth pre-check flow in provision/extend scripts so missing COMPUTE_API_KEY returns a clear error.
[done] AWAL mode now documented as requiring COMPUTE_API_KEY for management auth.
[done] Added explicit SSH key generation guidance in skill workflows:
       - ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/x402_compute
[done] Updated references/api-reference.md with AWAL + API key auth guidance.
[done] Kept password handling guidance explicit: SSH key is preferred, password is fallback.
[done] Removed in-skill CHANGELOG.md files per product decision (changelog moved outside skill folder).

Worker/Distribution Updates
